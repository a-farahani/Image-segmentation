## Synopsis

We provide approaches for finding cellular cilia from films using Tiramisu Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Optical Flow Threshold techniques. Here we apply those techniques to existing data sets to evaluate their performance and provide tools for others to apply and continue expansion. These endeavors come as the second project in the Spring 2019 University of Georgia CSCI 8360 course Data Science Practicum. 

## Outline

Historians credit Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek for the September 1675 discovery of cilia [Peter Satir]. While this served as landmark organelle discovery, microscope limitations held back confident analysis for centuries; thereby leaving little incentive for continued research. Even when the 20th century's rapid advances in techniques for cellular analysis, decades passed without provocative research discoveries, though functional understanding grew. Advances in the 1990's found cilia provide intraciliary/intraflagellar transport (ITF), an operation by which material may be shared between cells [KG Kozminski]. Soon thereafter, researchers discovered many instances where cilia ITF function correlated with genes and cellular function, including the Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) linking hydromorphic allele with dramatic defects [JH Moyer]. As cellular data continues rapid growth, the opportunities to derive correlation patterns between cilia data and symptoms/application show rising potential.

The derivation of patterns by which one could predict potential events, with rational certainty, primarily comes from statistical modeling. The rapid advances in data science techniques have brought about many opportunities to derive cilia's applicability. Crossing the expanding data science technical abilities with advanced cellular understanding have, in part, lead to the challenge of this project: automatically deriving which sections of a video are cilia. With accurate identification of cilia regions, scientists will have more data for integration with other statistical models to broaden the scope of predicting cellular function.

As part of the Spring 2019 University of Georgia CSCI 8360 course, this project's scope is limited to a predefined set of cellular videos along with mask images signifying which areas should be classified as cilia and which should not (please look in the doc directory for a copy of the assignment). To achieve the goals presented in this assignment, that being to accurately predict which regions should be classified as cilia, we implemented Python scripts that use Tiramisu CNN and Optical Flow Threshold techniques. The following sections discuss how to use this software. For more information regarding how the software was implemented along with discussions on other ideas tested and potential areas for future progress, please visit our Github wiki page.

## Data Organization

Being our course's second project assignment, it carries expectations regarding data we should expect and data we should generate. In this section we discuss the intrinsic data structure and format of our software, and how the two methods both expect different setup. We also built scripts that will allow you to get the data we used for the project along with another script (FormatImageData.py) that could translate the structure expected by Optical Flow into the structure expected by Tiramisu CNN.

Dr. Shannon Quinn provide us with a data directory consisting of the following:

((( FILL IN WITH PICTUREâ€¦ )))

Our Optical Flow software expects users will give it reference to a data directory that holds the files and subdirectories like the one above. If this is your first time working with our software, we would advise downloading a copy of the data we used to evaluate this model by executing the following command (bear in mind this process takes some time to full download all data):

```
$ mkdir ~/cilia
$ mkdir ~/cilia/SetOne
$ python FormatImageData.py -s ~/cilia/SetOne -g gs://uga-dsp/project2 -o ~/cilia/OpticalFlowData
```

In general, FormatImageData.py allows you to take image data (from a base directory that matches Quinn format), apply modifications to the images (like Gaussian Blur and Bilateral Filter), and send the new modified images to another base directory. This is a utility function that allows you to experiment with new ideas, see the Utilities section below.

Once you have a source directory, with files and subdirectories conforming with Quinn format expectations, you could generate another source directory having format that will conform with the CNN expectations using the utility program BuildTiramisuData.py. Tiramisu CNN expects something different because, being a Neural Network, you want to ensure the model does not over fit target training data by defining a validation set (the following image illustrates structural expectations):

((( Import an image!!! )))

Execution of the BuildTiramisuData.py will take the Quinn format data and generate data ready for use in the Tiramisu CNN with the following command:

```
$ python BuildTiramisuData -r ~/cilia/SetOne -v 65 -s 1 -o ~/cilia/tiramisuData
```

See more details about what the BuildTiramisuData script does in the Utilities section below. At this point you have two directories with data conforming to formats expected by Tiramisu CNN and Optical Flow, so you're ready for the next section.

## Methods

### Optical Flow



### Convolutional Neural Network (Tiramisu)

Our neural network codes are originate from https://github.com/bfortuner/pytorch_tiramisu.
- model/layers.py, model/tiramisu.py are basically all the same as the origianl repo, we only modified the dropout rate from 0.2 to 0.1
- /dataset/joint_transform.py is the same, expect we 
-- changed the rate of randomized crop area from [0.08, 1] to [0.45, 1]
-- changed the rate of the aspect ratio from [3/4, 4/3] to [0.5, 2]
- utils/training.py is the same, expect we added a test image prediction function, get_test_results
- ./dataset/cilia.py makes the cilia data to be appropriate fitted to the tiramisu model

Also, we got some inspiration from https://github.com/whusym/Cilia-segmentation-pytorch-tiramisu
to make the dataset and feed to the model.

### Convolutional Neural Network (Tiramisu) version2

In many respects, data science serves as successful fields for rapid algorithmic advances due to the intrensic diviersity in approximation problems. To put things another way, the many data analysis problems carry different expectations regarding accuracy, flexibility, and scalability, meaning the number of cases for conditional optimization expands distinct problems exponentially. One, of many, such adaptions from the University of Montreal [Simon Jegou] is the One Hundread Layers Tiramisu model, an extension of the Densely Connected
Convolutional Networks (DenseNets) model [Gao Huang]. 

Simon Jegou supplies a Github copy of the program, but we found a fairly useful Github packages from Brendan Fortuner (https://github.com/bfortuner/pytorch_tiramisu), Zujun Deng (https://github.com/ZijunDeng/pytorch-semantic-segmentation), and Maulik Shah (https://github.com/whusym/Cilia-segmentation-pytorch-tiramisu). Please visit our team's Wiki website to view detailed analysis of the functions supplied and how we applied them to cilia frames.
